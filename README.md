# World Wide Weather App

Weather App
A user-friendly weather application that provides real-time weather information for any specified city using the OpenWeatherMap API. The app features dynamic background images based on weather conditions and visually appealing icons for the moon and sun.

# User Experience
Design
The Weather App is designed to be simple and intuitive, providing users with all necessary weather information at a glance. The app includes dynamic backgrounds and visually appealing icons to enhance the user experience.

Colour Scheme
The app uses a gradient background that transitions from black to blue, symbolizing the sky and weather. Additional color schemes are used for text and buttons to ensure readability and aesthetic appeal.

Wireframes
Initial wireframes were designed to outline the layout of the app, including the positioning of the input field, button, weather information display, and introduction modal. These wireframes served as a blueprint for the final design.
